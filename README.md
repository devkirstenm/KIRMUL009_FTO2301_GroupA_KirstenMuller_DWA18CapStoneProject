# PodVerse - Final Capstone Project

Welcome to PodVerse, the ultimate platform to explore and enjoy podcasts! 🎙️🔥

## Overview

This project is the final capstone for the CodeSpace Software Development Program. It's a podcast platform built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The website link is [podverse.netlify.app](https://podverse.netlify.app).

## Project Features

I successfully implemented some of the key features:

✅Project is deployed to a custom Netlify URL

✅ All views in the app display correctly on the smallest mobile device available, “iPhone SE”. This can be emulated in Chrome Dev tools.

✅ All favicon information has been created an added correctly via https://realfavicongenerator.net/ (you are welcome to use any free PNG image you find on https://www.flaticon.com/)

✅ All metatag information has been created and added via https://metatags.io/ 

✅ All show data loaded via a fetch call from the https://podcast-api.netlify.app/shows

✅ When viewing a specific show, data is loaded via fetch from individual show endpoint

✅ User can view the details of a show broken down into seasons, sorted by number

✅ User can see the name of all available shows on the platform

✅ User sees preview image of shows when browsing

✅ User sees the amount of seasons per show as a number when browsing

✅ User sees a human-readable date as to when a show was last updated

✅ User sees what genres (as genre titles) a show is associated with when browsing

✅ User sees a preview image of seasons for a specific show

✅ Audio player shows current progress and episode length as timestamps

✅ Audio player is always visible, so the user can listen to episodes while they browse

✅ App remembers and shows the timestamp progress of any episode the user has started listening to

Due to time constraints, I couldn't complete all of the user stories, but I'm proud of the features that were implemented.
